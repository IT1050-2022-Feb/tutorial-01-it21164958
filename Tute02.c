/*Exercise 2 - Selection

Write a program to calculate the amount to be paid for a rented vehicle.

•	Input the distance the van has travelled
•	The first 30 km is at a rate of 50/= per km.
•	The remaining distance is calculated at the rate of 40/= per km.


e.g.

Distance -> 20
Amount = 20 x 50 = 1000


Distance -> 50
Amount = 30 x 50 + (50-30) x 40 = 2300*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int x; //variable declaration part
  float y;

  printf("input the distance the van has travelled :"); 
  //get input from user
  scanf("%d",&x);

  printf("input the 30km rate 50 per km :");
  scanf("%f",&y);

  amount=30 * 50 + (50-30) * 40 =2300 //calculation part
  printf("amount to be paid for a rented vehical :");
  //print amount 
  

  return 0;
}
